### Functionality:
A user will be able to sign-in using their student ID and a password. Once signed-in, users can immediately view their place in the queue if they have registered their roommates. There is a navigation bar that currently displays three pages: Home, Residence Halls, and Survey. The Residence Halls page has a dropdown menu that allows users to select a dorm, apartment, or quad. Once completed, pictures and floorplans of the selected housing option will appear on the screen. The Survey page currently has a dropdown menu that allows users to select their preferred housing option. It also allows users to input their roommates' student ID numbers. For future progress, the database will be able to determine the average earned credits. From there, it will create a queue from which users can select housing.

### Design:
The website uses the school colors of blue and grey. The logo was designed using Canva and a bootstrap template is being used to format the website.
